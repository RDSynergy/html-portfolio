<h1>The Best Movies According to Rob Dean</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</h3>
<p>I like this movie for the thought-provoking nature of the protaganist. It also lends a nostalgic feeling to what life during the late 60's would have been like.</p>

<h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
<p>This is the movie that started it all for me when it comes to learning about history. I came away from the movie feeling like history could be an adventure, and not just a boring classroom environment.</p>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>The visual effects from the original movie blew me away as a 7-year old child. It allowed me to imagine the possibilities of one day travelling to a galaxy far, far, away.</p>
